Hi! Welcome to the source code for my portfolio.
I created this portfolio on January 1st, 2014 as a promise to myself
to become a better programmer and to become an active member on GitHub.
I've come a long way since then, and I know I still have a long way to go!

My portfolio contains a two year snapshot of the projects that I've created
from scratch from Jan 2013 to Jan 2015. During that time, I've had the
fortunate opportunity with work with many outstanding people in New York City!
